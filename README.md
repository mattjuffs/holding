> A simple .NET Core Razor Page for pointing domains to

You can see it in use on the following domains:

* http://dustyspider.co.uk
* http://juffs.co.uk
* http://juffs.uk

---

## How does it work?

`Index.cshtml` determines the domain from the request and exposes it as a Property of the Model.

The HTML & CSS has been adapted from https://github.com/mattjuffs/framework `error.html`.
